We have 1 mummy hedgehog and 3, possibly 5, baby hedgehogs.

We were taking down our old shed and we found a prickle of prickly hedgehogs. I got straight to work on making them a house. I put a hinge on the roof so we could peek in. We are hoping to get a camera to watch them at night. The girls got to make a a sign and my sister marnie learnt how to work a drill.
