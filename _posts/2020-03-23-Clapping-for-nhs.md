We clap for the NHS and key workers to say thank you for keeping us safe during the pandemic.

In this picture, I am wearing my cubs uniform because it was St.Georges day and we usually parade but this year we couldn't as it is not safe to meet in big groups. Everybody in our street comes out and makes noise, we get to bang saucepans really loudly!!!
