Today I made Cornish pasties from scratch.

First I made the filling with .450g potato, finely diced .150g swede, finely diced .150g onion, finely chopped .300g beef skirt, finely chopped .Salt and black pepper .1tbsp plain flour .40g butter

Then I got out a roll of tesco pastry. Finally, I tucked the filling into the pastry and cooked them in the oven for 50 minutes. They were delicious!
