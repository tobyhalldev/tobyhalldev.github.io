Daddy and I worked very hard at decorating the dining room - it took a long time to cover all the scribbles on the walls!

I did lots of the painting all by myself, and was in charge of polyfilling any old picture hook holes in the walls. I also did all the caulking along the skirting board and picture rail myself. After a few days of hard work, we did it!
