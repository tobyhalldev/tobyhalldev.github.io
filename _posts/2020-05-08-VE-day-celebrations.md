We had a street party, we decorated the front of our house and made our own chocolate biscuits -(the twins really enjoyed these)

In the morning, we made bunting, had balloons,party hats,medals put pictures up, listened to music from the 40s and 30s and the girls dressed up in pretty dresses. Everybody in the street came out and we enjoyed a social distanced party with our neighbours. I think it is important to remember how bad the war was.
